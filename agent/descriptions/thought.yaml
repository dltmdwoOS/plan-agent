description: "This tool is a special tool. Instead of executing the tool directly\
  \ with tool_input, the 'message' tool_input functions as your thought process.\n\
  This tool must be triggered when no other tool is used. It can also be triggered\
  \ when additional reasoning is needed to respond to the user's question at the current\
  \ stage.\nIn this case, your thought should go into 'message', and that will be\
  \ delivered to the user.\n\nArgs:\n    message (str): Your thought."
